I did my own analysis I need may not be and India next issue
 When I do being I get this following results
 Except that to this trying to be efficient
 Notice we have this IP
 So itself is distributed over to machine's ip addresses which makes sense because you don't on to rely on just one machine
 One thing we might be reminded of is since is the blue is running now we may have to restart my craft again otherwise all traffic is going to get brilliant
 So much for me balancing
 At least somebody needs to check if SW is getting any traffic is not when it to restart my crab
 Hope this helps and please let me know if you have any questions over con comments
